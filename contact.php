                    <p>As an exercise in responsive design I redesigned the landing page for the New York Post. My inspiration came from newspaper layouts of the 1940â€™s, where content was crammed into an unending series of columns. My goal for this project was to create a fully responsive, multi-column layout that was readable across all devices.</p>
